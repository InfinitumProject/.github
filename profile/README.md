# Welcome to Infinitum!

## Nice to meet you!
I'm Universal82, the current owner of Infinitum. I want to do a lot with my projects but I can only dream big, so I decided to go all the way and start this organization!
Let's see here... I love the colour orange, I like cats *and* dogs, I think AI is cool rather than scary, and I think that's it! Icebreakers out of the way, I think anyone should be allowed to try and contribute. Feel free to submit a pull request with a contribution at any point, even if you think you suck at programming you might spark some new ideas even if your code wasn't accepted.

## Goals
We are small right now so I want to try and keep things realistic yet still having a clear larger goal visible on the horizon. I want to make a project I call Quill, the goal of Quill is to bring the feeling of a TTRPG game over the internet. Quill will be a terminal application at first but it would be nice if I could get it to render in a window later on. Infinitum is a project set on making a game engine that is separate from the game, with Infinitum the idea is that you only need to install it once and point it to the game's data directory to run the game. They will both make use of the MossLibrary that we are going to be focusing more on at first.

That's all for now, I'll try to keep this updated.
